# Animal Crossing: New Horizons Design Pattern Editor
An editor for Animal Crossing: New Horizons design patterns.

This software only works with hacked switchs and in combination with [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV/releases) to export your device saves, edit them with this tool and reimport them after that.

It's planned however to create an own hombrew app to transfer your savegame directly via USB/Network to the tool and vice versa.

## Features which are already working:
* Loading the savegame and showing all of your simple island design patterns.
* Cloning of design patterns
* Swapping of design patterns
* Deleting design patterns
* Importing a picture (png, gif, jpg, bmp) as design pattern with different color quantization algorithms etc.
* Importing a ACNL file.
* Support for full 24-bit colors. (of course you are still limited to a palette of 15 colors)
* Supports transparency.
* Exporting a picture (as png, gif, jpg, bmp) to share it with others
* Impoting a QR code (just use Import Image with an image where a QR code is visible)
* Of course saving your savegame.

## Features which are planned:
* Add suppot for pro design patterns.
* Add some more savegame editing (e.g. inventory)
* Add some 3d models like in Animal Crossing to see your creation like it would look in-game.
* Add a "Edit design" function like in-game.
* Create a NRO hombrew to transfer the savegame without manual work required.
